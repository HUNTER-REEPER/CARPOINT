                            <h2>Car Alternator</h2>
                            <p>The car alternator is a vital component of the vehicle's electrical system, converting mechanical energy into electrical power. It ensures that the battery remains charged and supplies electricity to various components, including headlights, infotainment systems, and ignition systems. A failing alternator can cause electrical malfunctions, dimming lights, and even engine stalling. Regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn-out parts can help avoid sudden failures.</p>

                            <p>The voltage regulator maintains a consistent voltage level, preventing overcharging or undercharging of the battery. It plays a critical role in ensuring a stable power supply for sensitive electronic systems such as ECU, sensors, and entertainment units. A malfunctioning regulator can lead to erratic performance and premature battery failure.</p>
